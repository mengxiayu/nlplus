Title: Towards Human-Centric NLP for Social Good

Abstract: Ruyuan will present two of her recent projects:  "User or Labor: An Interaction Framework for Human-Machine Relationships in NLP" which has been accepted for presentation at the Workshop on Data Science with Human in the Loop at EMNLP 2022; and "Everyone's Voice Matters: Quantifying and Distinguishing Subjective Annotation Disagreement Using Demographics Information," which has been accepted for presentation in the Special Track on AI for Social Impact at AAAI 2023.

Bio: Ruyuan Wan is a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame, working with Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola at the EPOCH (Empowering People, Organizations, and Communities through HCI) Lab. Her research focuses on the intersection between HCI and NLP with a social good orientation. Her current research includes understanding and mitigating online risks, especially for youth; studying bias in NLP for developing responsible and fair NLP; and conceptualizing human-machine interaction in the NLP context. Before starting her Ph.D., she received her Bachelor's degree in Statistics, as well as Master's degrees in Data Science and Linguistics, all from the University of Minnesota.
